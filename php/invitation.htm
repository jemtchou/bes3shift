This e-mail is sent to inform you that shift sign-up for a new BES-III data taking period is open. 
You are invited to participate in the data taking and book your shifts in advance.  
<br><br>
This time we present a new tool to manage your shifts. Before using it please read<br>
* current version of BES-III shift policy and<br>
* shift tool documentation<br>
which you can find at <a href=http://docbes3.ihep.ac.cn/~alexey/bes3shift/>http://docbes3.ihep.ac.cn/~alexey/bes3shift/</a>, and check your personal data in your profile.
<br><br>
After you book shifts, you will receive two reminder e-mails 3 and 7 days before the shift block starts. You will also receive a confirmation e-mail after any action which concerns your shifts (book, cancel, exchange your shifts, change password etc.)
