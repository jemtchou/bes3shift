<p class=ttit>BESIII Shift Policy <sup>*</sup><p>

<p class=tsubtit>1)	General</p>

<p class=parag>Shift-taking is an important part of obligations for all BESIII members. According to our experience during BESIII running, it is necessary to draft a formal shift policy to make it clear. 

<p class=parag>The shift load should be distributed among BESIII institutes according to the number of authors from each institute who will sign BESIII physics papers.

<p class=parag>Every institute has the freedom about who should take the shifts, for how long, as long as it takes its share. The students from non-IHEP institutes stationing at IHEP will take the shares of their home institutes.

<p class=parag>The shift duty is accumulative, if one institute can’t meet its share in a run period, the institute should take more shifts in the following run period to meet the requested share. (Please see shift counting) 

<p class=parag>Each day there are 3 shifts: Day shift 8:00-16:10;  Evening shift 16:00-24:10; Night shift 24:00-8:10. Shift taker should come at least 10 minutes early for exchanging information.

<p class=parag>One shift crew consists of two persons, one ordinary shift member and one shift chief. The shift chief should be an experienced and qualified person who has been passed the qualification check by run coordinator. There must be one Chinese speaker on any shift.

<p class=parag>In addition to shift crews, there will be one weekly shift coordinator who will be responsible for data taking in the week. There are on-call experts, responsible for solving problems in corresponding hardware systems, 24 hours on duty. 

<p class=parag>There is a list of persons served as weekly coordinators, shift chief and on-call experts. We encourage more people to be qualified to be in the list.

<p class=parag>After shifts are assigned, it is allowed to exchange shifts if agreed by two persons involved, but shift chief can only be replaced by another shift chief, and this arrangement should be immediately recorded in the shift data base.

<p class=parag>Before each run period, registration of shifts is firstly opened to foreign institutes for one week, then Chinese institutes outside Beijing for second week and then opened to all institutes.

<p class=tsubtit>2) Shift Counting

<p class=parag>Shifts are counted in shift point base. To encourage people to take shifts in night, and in Chinese National Public Holidays (11 days/year). Shifts will have different points accordingly, and share of shifts will be based on shift points.
 <p class=parag>
  <table class=parag>
  <tr><td>Shift type</td><td>Points</td><tr>
  <tr><td>Regular day or evening shifts</td><td>1.0</td><tr>
  <tr><td>Regular night shift</td><td>1.5/shift</td><tr>
  <tr><td>Holiday day or evening shifts</td><td>1.5/shift</td><tr>
  <tr><td>Holiday night shift</td><td>2.0/shift</td><tr>
  <tr><td>Weekly run coordinators</td><td>1.0/day</td><tr>
  <tr><td>On-call experts</td><td>1.0/week</td><tr>
  </table>
  </p>

<p class=parag>On-call experts are assigned to following 16 systems:</p>

  <p class=parag>
  <ul class=parag>
  <li>MDC and MDC electronics</li>
  <li>EMC and EMC electronics</li>
  <li>TOF and TOF electronics</li>
  <li>Muon and Muon electronics</li>
  <li>Gas + Beampipe</li>
  <li>Online DAQ</li>
  <li>Trigger</li>
  <li>SC magnet</li>
  <li>Slow control</li>
  <li>Software + DQM</li>
  <li>Luminosity + gas monitors</li>
  <li>Beam energy measurement system</li>    
   </ul>
  </p>

<p class=parag>The shift point assignment could be adjusted if it is approved by IB. It is not allowed for one person to take two conjunct shifts (not allowed to take shift for 16 hours continuous). 

<p class=parag>People should take expert shifts. You do not need to speak Chinese to be an ``expert''. Once you have taken a few non-expert shifts, you can promote yourself to ``expert''.

<p class=parag>Shifters who take empty shifts are responsible for entering their name into the shift schedule. Failure to do so results in the loss of credit.

<p class=parag>The statistics of shift points for all BESIII institutes will be updated and reported in collaboration meeting to help each participating institute manage its shift arrangement.

<p class=tsubtit>3) Eligibility of Shift Takers

<p class=parag>The quality of the shift is important for good data. Shifters should attend shift training. It is suggested that videos be made in both Chinese and English for shift training. Anyone who has not had a shift within the last year should undergo shift training and/or attend a shift before their regularly scheduled shift.

<p class=parag>Individuals should be listed on the shift schedule rather than institutions. If an institution wants to sign up for a block of shifts, the IB representative's name should be listed, and he/she is responsible for filling in the shift name of the actual shifter. 

<p class=parag>Documentations for shift duties and instructions are written and maintained by Shift Committee. A combined database for the shifts and members are suggested to improve the shift program interface, and correct the shift summary statistics. 

<p class=parag>Every week in Tuesday, there is regular shift training in the counting room to help new comer to be familiar with the system.

<p class=tsubtit>4) Liability and Failure 

<p class=parag>According to our experience in past, it has been observed that there were non-qualified shift takers, missing shift takers and so on. IB representatives should take the responsibility to make their own shift takers to be a qualified and responsible member of shift crew.

<p class=parag>IB representative contact information will be kept in counting house. If a shift taker shows up late or doesn’t show up for a scheduled shift, the member’s IB representative will be contacted immediately and the proper solution should be found. Failure to act correctly, extra shifts will be charged to the specific institute according to run coordinator’s suggestion, and this will be ratified by IB. Those who seriously violate shift policy will be exposure to the whole collaboration.
