<p class=ttit>INTRODUCTION<p>

<p class=parag>
BES-III shift web application has all necessary tools to maintain and support
the shifting routine. It is based on Apache web server, MySQL database, and is tested
for the 'big five' browsers: Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safari, IE.
Best viewed with anything but IE. If you are still using IE - the 'Document Mode' setting in the browser must be changed from 'Quirks' to 'Internet Explorer standards'.
</p>

<p class=ttit>PROFILE</p>

<p class=parag>
Each BES-III member has got now a personilized access to the shifting system and, accordingly, an access
to his personal profile. Your name at the lower right screen corner is a link to invoke a form
for viewing/editing your personal data. Some form fields are read-only. If any read-only data is wrong, please contact the BES-III shift manager and your institute representative.<br>
Notice, please, a password field when left empty results to automatic generating a new one, that
would be sent to you by e-mail to the e-mail address set in the BES-III database.<br>
Correct e-mail address is very important as all the notifications and confirmations would be sent there.
So be sure it is set correctly in the BES-III Collaboration database.

<p class=ttit>SHIFTS</p>

<p class=parag>
Having studied the shift policy, read this instruction and checked up or edited your personal profile - you are ready to manage your shifts.
<p class=parag>There are several views for that, the default one is a 'Calendar View'. This is a page you normally see on entering the system. The navigation is very simple: you've got a "Home" link that brings you back to 'Calendar View' - there is a 'home' icon and the title 'Bes-III Shifts' in the top left page corner.
<p class=parag>Below that is a small calendar with 'previous month', 'next month' red arrows, direct month and year selectors, month day selectors. That would be quite enough to find and view any date within a shift round - past, current or future.
<p class=parag>Two buttons below the small calendar allow you to switch between two views - 'month' (default) and 'round'. Round view allows to look at the whole data taking period at once and it is described below.
<p class=parag>Round, institution and author input fields are autocompleted while you type in.
'Round' and 'Institution' fields start doing it after the 1nd symbol typed, 
'Author' - after the 2nd symbol typed. These fields supply data for 'Roster' and 'Stats' tables, which are described below.

<p class=parag>To the right is a monthly display of all open or booked shifts.

<p class=parag><b>To book a shift</b> you need to point and click on any 'open' position specified: 
chief or ordinary shifter; night, day or evening. Shift blocks are highlighted according to your
choice. Once you choose a shift block, a dialogue with all necessary info will pop up for your approval/cancelling. As soon as you 'book' a shift - you'll be able to 'edit' it: cancel or exchange for another block. Note, that holidays are marked with pink color - for you to know when you are assigned 0.5 extra points per shift. After you book shifts, you will receive two reminder e-mails 3 and 7 days before the shift block starts.
 
<p class=parag><b>Cancelling shifts</b> is simple: select your shift block by clicking with a mouse pointer on your name and press button 'Reject' in the dialogue which pops up. If you cancel shift very close to the start of your shift block, you will be requested to ask the BES-III shift manager to approve your action.

<p class=parag><b>Exchanging shifts</b> is done nearly the same way: first - select the shift block that you wish to exchange. Then select the one you'd like to get from another shifter. And at last - ask
that shifter to exchange his/her block with yours (this is done at the left panel).

<p class=parag>After any action (booking, cancelling or exchange) you should get a notification e-mail.

<p class=tsubtit>Round View</p>

<p class=parag>
This view is convenient to check up the whole shift round for open shift at a glance. The day cells are colored according to the legend below the table. Clicking on a month would bring you to the selected month view to manage shifts. Hovering mouse over a holiday would display its name.
</p>

<p class=ttit>ROSTER</p>
<p class=parag>
To view the whole list of BES-III institutions just press the 'Roster' button. 
If you'd like to see members of a particular institution, select this institution by starting
to type its abbreviated name (at least 2 letters) in the form and then select it from the 
autocompletion list appearing below. The form is case insensitive.<br>
</p>

<p class=ttit>STATISTICS</p>
<p class=parag>
Compared to 'Roster' operation - you may additionally specify a shift period
to get the statistics, and get that of a single person.
